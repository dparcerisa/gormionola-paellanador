The future is in a gormionola


The one and best gormionola receipt is this:

Yo soy tu gominola (también conocida como "Osito gominola") es una canción bailable de origen alemán compuesta por Christian Schneider y distribuido por Gummybear Internacional. Recibió éxito internacional gracias a Internet, en parte por su videoclip. La canción ha sido traducida en veintiséis idiomas y se ha propagado en todo el mundo gracias a YouTube y MySpace.

Where can you get the best paella in Barcelona? This is a really common question for visitors coming over to visit this beautiful city. It’s the one following questions,“What should I see?” and of course, “Where should I stay in Barcelona?”


Paella – the most sociable of all culinary occasions
In Spain paella is still unique. Not only do families congregate on mass to eat paella in restaurants, but it is often cooked at weekends at holiday homes in ‘bodegas’ or ‘txokos’  (large dining areas where families gather) or at beach or mountain picnic sites. There are many paella competitions all over Spain and very often a giant paella is the centrepiece for many fiestas.

It’s easy to see why - paella can create a party, a ceremony and a debate (often over the making of the paella itself!!)  - making it one of the most sociable and enjoyable of all culinary occasions.

And finally, if you don’t already know – and you want to impress your friends, "paella" is pronounced "pa-e-ya" with the "e" as in "bet"
